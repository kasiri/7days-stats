React scaffold added

Quick start

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Run dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173/ to see the React app. The original site index was preserved as `index.static.html`.

Notes
- The scaffold uses Vite + React and renders the existing HTML pages by fetching them and injecting their body content.
- Static assets (style.css, images, main.js, etc.) remain in the project root and are accessible to the scaffold.
